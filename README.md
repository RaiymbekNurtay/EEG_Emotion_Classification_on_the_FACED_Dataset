# EEG_Emotion_Classification_on_the_FACED_Dataset
[cite_start]This study benchmarks classical machine learning models for multiclass EEG emotion classification on the FACED dataset[cite: 1, 3]. [cite_start]Using differential entropy features, LightGBM with a One-versus-Rest strategy achieved 77% accuracy and a 77% macro F1-score, making it competitive with deep learning models.
